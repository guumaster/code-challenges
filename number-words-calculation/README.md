# WELCOME to the Company X Code Challenge!

Please provide a solution in code for the problem below. If you have any question please create an Issue in this repository.

**Note:** The challenge can be solved in the language you are more comfortable with. This also applies for the tests, some in Javascript are included, but you can add your own in the language/testing framework of your choice.

## Sum of Numbers

You should create an CLI application that takes a sum as a string in either digits, spanish or english and returns its result as string in the same language (digits/spanish/english).

**Note: In case you don't speak Spanish, feel free to NOT implement the sum in Spanish or implement it in another language you are comfortable with**

The string will be two numbers and an infix operator (+/mas/plus).

Max number is 999 and min number is 0.

The entry point of the CLI is the file `calculate`. This file already already exists in the repository but implementation is missing.

### Tests

Tests are included.

Before running the tests you must have node >= 8 installed and run `npm install` in the console at the root folder of the project.

Run `npm test` in the console to execute the test suite.
